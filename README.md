## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS transitions for hover effects

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox. I learned how to effectively use CSS custom properties (variables) to maintain a consistent color scheme throughout the project.

I'm particularly proud of the hover and focus effects on the social links:

```css
.link-btn:hover, .link-btn:focus {
  background-color: var(--green);
  color: var(--grey-900);
}
```

I also improved my understanding of responsive design by implementing a mobile-first approach and adding media queries for smaller screens:

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .card {
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility features and implementing more complex animations. I also plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
